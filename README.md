# The Python Banyan Framework

![](https://github.com/MrYsLab/razmq/blob/master/documentation/images/razbot.png)

Quickly build asynchronous, event driven application components that communicate with each other using
user defined protocol messages published to the network.

All Python Banyan components automatically connect to the "Banyan Backplane" at execution start-up.
The Python Banyan Framework hides all of the complexity of network configuration and message serialization. The entire
programming framework is a single class. Simply create a class that inherits the base class and your executable
components can be located on a single computer or across multiple computers.

Python Banyan is multi-platform. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. It can even control the GPIO of an MCU such as a
Raspberry Pi 3.

The_**Python Banyan**_ framwework allows you to create applications using network connected components by passing
user defined protocol messages between the components. It works on Linux, Windows and MAC
A Kivy based GUI is provided to drive the robot.
