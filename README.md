# VERSION 3 COMING SOON
The Python Banyan Framework is a lightweight, reactive framework used to
create flexible, non-blocking, event driven, asynchronous applications.
It was designed primarily to aid in the implementation of real-time physical computing applications
 for devices such as
 the Raspberry Pi, ESP8266,  and Arduino,
but may easily be applied to projects outside of the physical programming domain.
