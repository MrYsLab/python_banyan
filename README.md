# UNDER CONSTRUCTION VERSION 3 IS BEING READIED FOR RELEASE

The Python Banyan Framework is a lightweight, reactive framework used to
create flexible, non-blocking, event driven, asynchronous applications.
It was designed primarily to aid in the implementation of real-time physical computing applications
 for devices such as
 the Raspberry Pi, ESP8266,  and Arduino,
but may easily be applied to projects outside of the physical programming domain.

* It utilizes a network based Publish/Subscribe model.
* Banyan applications may reside on a single computer or distributed across multiple computers without having to change source code.
* Supports transport of Numpy data.
* Includes an MQTT Gateway to connect a Banyan network to an MQTT network.
* A full "learn by example" [User's Guide](https://mryslab.github.io/python_banyan/) is provided.
* Being used as the data transport backbone at [Palace Games Escape Rooms](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-escape-room/).
* Compatible Banyan Frameworks are available for [JavaScript](https://github.com/MrYsLab/js-banyan), [Ruby](https://github.com/MrYsLab/rb_banyan), and
[Java](https://github.com/MrYsLab/javabanyan). Components written in any of these languages can interact with components of a differing language without modification.
* Runs on Python 2 or Python 3 (recommended)
